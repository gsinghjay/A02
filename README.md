# Part 2

- **Branch**: A separate line of development. It allows you to diverge from the main line of development and continue to work independently without affecting the main line.

- **Clone**: Making a copy of the repository on your local machine. 

- **Commit**: The process of saving your changes to the local repository. A commit is like a snapshot of your project's current state, which you can return to at any time.

- **Fetch**: A command that downloads content from a remote repository to your local repository. It updates your remote-tracking branches but does not merge the changes into your current working files.

- **GIT**: Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. It enables multiple developers to work together on a project and tracks every change made to the files.

- **GitHub**: GitHub is a web-based interface that uses Git for version control. It allows users to host and review code, manage projects, and build software alongside millions of developers.

- **Merge**: A way to bring the diverged development history back together. It combines the changes from one branch into another, typically into the main branch.

- **Merge Conflict**: Occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits. It requires manual intervention to resolve the differences.

- **Push**: The act of sending your committed changes to a remote repository, such as GitHub. 

- **Pull**: The process of fetching and downloading content from a remote repository and immediately updating the local repository to match that content. 

- **Remote**: A version of your project that is hosted on the internet or network somewhere. You can have several of them, which can be read-only or read/write for you.

- **Repository**: A directory where Git has been initialized to start tracking and recording changes to the files. It can be local (on your machine) or remote (e.g., on GitHub).
